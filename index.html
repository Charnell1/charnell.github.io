 <h3>About Charnell</h3>
 <p>I first gained interest in high school in an optinal coding class. Like anything else, I was confused at the beginning, but caught on eventually which made the class all the more fun. I wasn't sure if I woudld be able to school for this, but as time passed, it became my ideal goal thanks to a few ideas of mine. Now I have mind set on becoming a developer and that is what I intend to do.</p>
 <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy music. I play the piano in my free time and it is a great way for me to relax.</p>
